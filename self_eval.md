# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
   ~Conditionals are useful to use as a variable in your code whenever you are trying to compare.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
   ~That is a hard question because until it is looked over by an instructor I won't have any idea.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
   ~I enjoyed making my own document and adding another +1 to the fork of the github. Pretty satisfying to see the number of forks go up.
